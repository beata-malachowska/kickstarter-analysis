# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Kickstarter dataset was used in order to perform an analysis to show which compaigns are successful one. (They asked me to do it at the BootCamp training so I did it.)

### Purpose

To explore the factors able to predict the outcome of the campaign for a girl name Louise who wants to launch her our campaing to do a musical. 
Aim 1 : Explore how month of the launch affects the outcome of the campaignes
Aim 2: Explore how goal range affect the percentage of the outcome of the campaings

## Analysis and Challenges

- For aim 1: Creating a proper pivot tables with appropriate fields. Deleting campaigns in progress and selecting "months" as data for X axis. 
- For aim 2: Using countifs function to count number of campaings in each goal range and each outcome

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

I used countif instead of countifs function and I was confused. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The highest number of successful campaigns among theater category were launch in May-July period.
The highest number of failed campaigns among theater category were launch in October period.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The highest percentage of successful campaignes were those with lowest goals (<$5000).
The campaings with highest goals (>$45000) had the lowest success percentage. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

It uses only data from one platform - Kickstarter.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Graph/table comparing sucess rate across different countries.
Graph/table comparing the length of the campaign and the sucess percentage.
